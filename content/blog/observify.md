A little over a year ago, I walked into my first ever tech interview. A freshman with little knowledge of data structures and web development got selected for his first software-development internship. Having interned at another good startup afterward, infused a lot of enthusiasm in me for working in teams, building products, and learning things.

I, as you may know, love working at startups and watching them grow. Looking back at the past few months, I am amazed to see how much I have grown with respect to knowledge and understanding with realization that there is a lot more for me to learn.
