Each one of us have some goals to complete, things to learn, and places to visit. With the year getting ended, it is time to lock back and see what all did we do for the last 365 days.

Well, 2018 have been a phenominal year for me. I got to meet a lot of great people, built connections and learned things.
I am really happy to see most of my goals getting completed. I hope you will be happy too, with what you have achieved personally.
Here in this post I am summing up what all I did in the last 12 months.

- <emoji>:closed_book:</emoji> **Read 16 books**. Developing a habit of reading was my focus for 2018. I really enjoyed the time
  reading, understanding facts and learning a lot from the books I read this year. My favourite books were **"Factfulness"** by Hans Rosling
  and **"The Power of your Subconscious Mind"** by Joseph Murphy.
- <emoji>:computer:</emoji> **Working at HackerEarth** is where the major part of 2018 was well spent. I got to meet and make
  connections with great people at HackerEarth. I interned at HackerEarth on-site for 3 months and then continued
  remotely. It is definitely a great place to work and learn.
- <emoji>:trophy:</emoji> **2nd Runner up in The Great Hackathon twice**. A quaterly organised internal hackathon at
  HackerEarth, I with my teammates came 3rd twice. I haven't seen such an amazing culture and work flow anywhere else.
  Really loved those 24hr hackathons and building product features.
- <emoji>:airplane:</emoji> **Lived in Bangalore for 3 months**. An amazing experience to be cherished. Living alone
  for 3 months period was great to learn planning, time management, not shutting the alarm & sleep again and what not. The all time beautiful weather of
  Bangalore is what no one can ever forget. Though I was unable to cover all the famous eating spots in Bangalore,
  I certainly went to the best ones. I had 2 trips to **Nandi Hills**, apparantly one was not enough to be satisfied by
  the soothing breeze and sunrise. Also went for a one day tour to **Mysore**.
- <emoji>:fire:</emoji> **Got selected for Digital Product School, Munich**. It is a 3 months long product development
  program. I was selected for the batch 6 (Jan to March) of DPS. In a team of 4 with 2 software developers,
  1 designer, and 1 product manager each; you have to work with companies including BMW, Audi, Facebook, and IBM;
  researching about the currently faced consumer problems, ideating about the solutions and finally building a product.
- <emoji>:incoming_envelope:</emoji> **Got offers from Grofers and Postman**. I have very recently got summer intern
  offers from them. Both had a really great interview process.
